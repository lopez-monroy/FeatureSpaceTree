Welcome to FeatureSpaceTree,

I created FeatureSpaceTree because I wanted an easy way to perform
text-preprocessing in text-classification or others specific tasks related to
machine learning and text-mining.

FeatureSpaceTree is a framework for scientists and students of computer science
that facilitates the textual-feature-extraction and representation of documents.
These are two common previous stages in text-classification.

Currently there are very powerful tools to perform machine learning in a very
simple way (e.g. Weka on Java, Spider on Matlab). However, feature-extraction
and representation of documents is another matter. Normally, we program the
modules directly in a scripting programming language (e.g. perl, python),
especially when the task is small. Other times we use some libraries that
provide many of the common functions (e.g. NLTK, Apache UIMA). These last tools
are the big boys of Natural Language Processing. However, the learning curve
could be hard, and normally we ended assembling the union of several components
and witring a lot of lines of code.

In some cases we are missed a tool like weka, but for text-mining. Where you 
just select some things and parameters in order to prove and idea, or be able 
to extend a class and add your new method. This is, sometimes we would like to 
test ideas in a very fast way in order to know if it deserves our attention. 
Well, FeatureSpaceTree aims to be something like that. Of course, currently it
is far from that goal, but I think that every day it is closer. 

FeatureSpaceTree aims to be a tool for feature-extraction and representation of
documents. The main idea is just stating what features you want to extract and
some representation. This is, on the command line (future GUI) we chose
the terms (plus multiple filters used before and after the extraction) and
which representation will be used (using of multiple parameters for each
representation). and the better is, ...
Without programming a single line of code!!! ... obviously you can also use the
API inside your own code :-)

INSTALLATION
============
You will need the pip software (also needed to install NLTK) in order to install
FeatureSpaceTree. 

Type into a terminal the following command:

$ sudo pip install git+https://github.com/beiceman/FeatureSpaceTree.git#egg=FeatureSpaceTree

If no errors, then congratulations you can use FeatureSpaceTree:

$ simple_exp yaml_file_with_parameters.yaml

INTRODUCTION
============

The main idea is that you will specify the following data:

1. - What attributes are needed to extract from the document corpus
(punctuation, words, n-grams at the character level, n-grams at word level,
word length, sentence length).

2. - Which filters will be applied to extract each of the attributes
(the n most frequent, n random, etc.). You could use filter on the text
before the term is extracted (e.g. eliminate capital letters). You could use
filter on tokens extracted (e.g. apply lematization).

3. - What representations will be used for these attributes, for example:
	* Bag of Words (BoW)
	* Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
	* CSA
	* Bag of Terms (BoT)
	* Document Ocurrence Representation (DOR)
	* Term Cocurrence Representation (TCOR)

* Although the main idea is that SpaceTree works as a whole,
it is important to say that at the same time it is flexible to:

1. - Use each module independently.
2. - Extend the functionality with new modules of terms, filters
     and representations.

The output of SpaceTree will be:

1.- The representation of documents in a know format (currently just weka ".arff"
 and CSV format is available, however you can easily add other custom formats).
2.- A Yaml file which specify the edges of the spaces for each attribute
(ok better see the example :-) ).
3.- The vocabulary corpus for each space of attributes
4.- Some files with useful information to analyze.

HOW IT WORKS?
=============

Initially SpaceTree works through the command line interface. It runs the main script and
parameters are provided through a YAML file (thanks to this, also would be easy to develop
a GUI that only treat YAML files).

$ simple_exp /somewhere/my_parameters.yaml 

An example of a YAML file is:

config_base:

  categories: [cat1, cat2, cat3]
  experiment_base_path: /home/aplm/Experimentos/validaciones/bow/exp_validacion
  experiment_name: exp_validacion

  corpus:
    type_corpus: EnumCommonTemplate.TRAIN_TEST

      corpus_path: /home/aplm/nltk_data/corpora/validacion/train

      - type_filter_corpus: EnumFiltersCorpus.FULL
    
    test_corpus:
      corpus_path: /home/aplm/nltk_data/corpora/validacion/test
      filters_corpus:
      - type_filter_corpus: EnumFiltersCorpus.FULL

  # For example, the following parameters are needed for a java program based on weka.

    n_folds: 10
    n_classifiers: 1

# Once the corpus is specified, you will tell to SpaceTree what you want to extract.
# It is done through a tree scheme, where in the nodes you specify what attributes
# are going to be extracted and filtered. An in the leafs you will specify How
# those attributes will be represented.
